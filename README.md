LINKEDLN: https://www.linkedin.com/in/arun-kumar-a0a551230

OVERVIEW

 This Project involves the development of a machine learning model to predict resale prices of flats in Singapore. By leveraging historical transaction data, the goal is to assist potential buyers and sellers in estimating the resale value of a flat.

MOTIVATION

  The Singapre resale flat market is known for its competitiveness, making it challenging for individuals to accurately gauge the resale value of their property.  This Project aims to address this challenge by employing machine learning techniques to provide users with reliable resale price predictions based on various influential factor.

SKILLS DEMONSTRATED

DATA WRRANGLING AND EDA:

  Collect and preprocess resale flat transaction data.

  Conduct exploratory data analysis to uncover insights and trends

MODEL BUILDING

  Choose and train a regression model using historical data.

MODEL DEPLOYMENT

  Develop an interactive web application using Streamlit.

  Deploy the application on the Render platform, ensuring accessibility to users.

DOMAIN

  The project operates within the real estate domain, specifically focusing on the resale flat market in Singapore.  It involves understanding the dynamics of this market and applying machine learning to enhance valuation accuracy.

PROBLEM STATEMENT

  The Challenge lies in accurately predicting resale values, considering factors such as location, flat type, floor area and lease duration.  This project seeks to provide a practical solution that benefits both buyers and sellers in making well-informed decisions.

PROJECT SCOPE

  1. DATA COLLECTION AND PREPROCESSING

       Collect and clean historical resale flat transaction data from the Singapore Housing and Development Board(HDB).

  2. FEATURE ENGINEERING

       Extract relevant features such as town, flat tye, storey range, floor area, flat model and lease commence date.  Create additionalfetures to improve prediction accuracy.

  3. MODEL SELECTION AND TRAINING

       Choose a suitable regression model and train it on the historical dataset.

  4.MODEL EVALUATION

       Assess the model's predictive performance using regression metrics like MAE, MSE, RMSE AND R2 SCORE.

  5. STREAMLIT WEB APPLICATION

       Develop an intuitive web application using Streamlit, allowing users to input flat details for price predictions.

  6. DEPLOYMENT ON RENDER

       Deploy the Streamlit application on the Render platfom or anyu cloud platform for online accessibility.
     
  7. TESTING AND VALIDATION

       Thouroughly test the deploued application to ensure accurate predictions and seamless functionality

  DELIVERABLES

  Machine Learning Model

    A well-trained model ready for resale price predictions.

  WEB APPLICATION

    An interactive and user-friendly web application deployed on Render.

  DOCUMENTATION

    Clear instructions on using the application.

  PROJECT REPORT

    A Comprehensive report summarizing data analysis, model development and deployment processes.

  RESULTS

    This projecg aims to empower potential buyers and sellers in the Singapore housing market, providing them with a valuable tool for estimating resale prices and makinginformed decisions.  It also showcases the practical application of machine learning in the real estate sector and web development.
